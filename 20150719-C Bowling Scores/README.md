Bowling Scores handling in C.

This project was attempted despite my general lack of C programming experience.  The program parses the score text listing, but the final score is not calculated.  I realized a rather major architecture mis-step once I started trying to determine how to calculate the score properly.  In an hour I wasn't able to complete this project, but I did learn quite a bit.
