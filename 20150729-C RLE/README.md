# C RLE encoding and decoding

This project has the goal of performing Run Length Encoding on strings in the format of [A-Za-z].  I was able to accomplish encoding in an hour, but not fully impliment decoding.

This was a good learning experience.  I believe the decoder could be implimented in another 2 hours.  I also believe I could write the decoder in perl in 30 minutes.  Perhaps this is a good way to judge my knowledge levels between the two languages (and the lack of regex in standard C).
