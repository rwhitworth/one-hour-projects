# Outdoor burn day detection and email generation

This project sends an email alerting if today is a outdoor burn day in Gwinnett County, so I'll know when myself (or my neighbors) are allowed to burn debris.

The script has only be tested against two different days' data - one with a 'burn day' message and one without.  Hopefully it works, but without more time (ie, not a one hour project) I won't know, so for the purpose of this task I am done.
