# one-hour-projects
What one hour of work looks like

Projects in this repo were started and "finished" in one hour.  At the end of the hour code was uploaded regardless of final state.  The goal is to teach myself the ability to create a workable demo in an hour.

I plan to use technologies I am unfamiliar with for these mini projects.  Languages I don't know, libraries/toolkits I haven't used, and design patterns, concepts, etc that are foreign to me.  This is about learning not about usefulness.

# "Completed" Projects
* 2015-07-09 - <a href="https://rwhitworth.github.io/one-hour-projects/ColorClock.html">Color Clock</a>.  A lunchtime project.
* 2015-07-09 - <a href="https://rwhitworth.github.io/one-hour-projects/CanvasDemo.html">Canvas Demo</a>, aka, Random Colored Squares.
* 2015-07-10 - Trivia Crack Cheat demo.  Requires Fiddler and FaceBook's version of Trivia Crack.  A lunchtime project.
* 2015-07-10 - get-repos.pl, a script to list the repositories for a user.
* 2015-07-11 - <a href="https://rwhitworth.github.io/one-hour-projects/charts.html">c3/d3 charts</a>.  A 'baby is sleeping' project of less than one hour.
* 2015-07-19 - Bowling Scores, a C program to calculate a score in 10 pin bowling.
* 2015-07-20 - Support for long options with getopt, in bash.

# "Completed" Non-Projects
Work done for other projects that I want to track.
* 2014-04-07 - <a href="https://github.com/tokuhirom/Test-SharedFork/pull/12">Test::SharedFork</a> perl module fixes for installing in Cygwin environment.
* 2015-05-29 - <a href="https://github.com/illusori/bash-tap/pull/4">bash-tap</a>, bash script to add TAP functional testing to bash scripts.  Created tests for the bash-tap script (note the irony of a testing library without tests).  Implimented bail_out(), note(), and skip() functions.
* 2015-07-06 - <a href="https://github.com/alexoslabs/HTTPSScan/pull/1">HTTPSScan</a>, bash script to test for HTTPS vulnerabilities on local server.  Added function to test for online host before running, removed 2 false positive tests, and updated for Cygwin environment.
* 2015-07-12 - <a href="https://github.com/dagolden/Capture-Tiny/pull/35">Capture::Tiny</a> perl module fixes for installing in Cygwin environment.
* 2015-07-14 - <a href="https://github.com/gisle/encode-locale/pull/17">Encode::Locale</a> perl module fixes for installing in a Cygwin environment.

# Future project ideas
* php detect similar JPEG images
* autoit automate Windows software
* powershell to use .net classes to encrypt/decrypt, or compress, or maybe an md5sum for Windows
* C handle command-line options (no cheating with getopt or whatnot)
* C# screensaver, starting with teh time-server codebase
* C# charting, using Microsoft's solution perhaps?
