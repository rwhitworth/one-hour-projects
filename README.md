# one-hour-projects
What one hour of work looks like

Projects in this repo were started and "finished" in one hour.  At the end of the hour code was uploaded regardless of final state.  The goal is to teach myself the ability to create a workable demo in an hour.

I plan to use technologies I am unfamiliar with for these mini projects.  Languages I don't know, libraries/toolkits I haven't used, and design patterns, concepts, etc that are foreign to me.  This is about learning not about usefulness.
