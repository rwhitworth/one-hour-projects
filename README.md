# one-hour-projects
What one hour of work looks like

Projects in this repo were started and "finished" in one hour.  At the end of the hour code was uploaded regardless of final state.  The goal is to teach myself the ability to create a workable demo in an hour.

I plan to use technologies I am unfamiliar with for these mini projects.  Languages I don't know, libraries/toolkits I haven't used, and design patterns, concepts, etc that are foreign to me.  This is about learning not about usefulness.

# "Completed" Projects

# Future project ideas
* php detect similar JPEG images
* autoit automate Windows software
* powershell to use .net classes to encrypt/decrypt, or compress, or maybe an md5sum for Windows
* C to read bowling scores (per frame) from a text file and compute final score
* C handle command-line options (no cheating with getopt or whatnot)
* C# screensaver, starting with teh time-server codebase
* C# charting, using Microsoft's solution perhaps?
